### About
Nvim config geared towards academic writing in [Typst](https://typst.app/) inspired by [this blog](https://www.ohrg.org/typst/writing-in-typst).

So far, I have added fuzzy finder functionality and LSP completion using [nvim-mini](https://github.com/nvim-mini) and [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig). Language support for Typst comes from [tinymist](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist).
